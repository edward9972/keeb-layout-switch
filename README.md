# Keeb Layout Switch

*EN/RU or EN/DE without the language bar hunt.*

## What Keeb Layout Switch is

This repository is **Keeb Layout Switch**, a desktop utility. EN/RU or EN/DE without the language bar hunt.

A layout change should be one command during a call.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Highlights

- Language tag
- Shows current
- List installed
- User-level

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
